The dataset is already included with the uploaded secNB_AID.rar package of the project. Just download & extract it and open the solution using Visual Studio 2017. Set the SEALExamples as the start-up project. The implementation uses Microsoft's SEAL library v3.2 found in https://github.com/microsoft/SEAL
For better communication and computation costs (performances), run the code in Release mode.
